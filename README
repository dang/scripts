dang's *nix environment

This is my (increasingly complicated) *nix environment, complete with
complicated install method.  It consists of:

- A full bash environment, tailored for several flavors of *nix
- A full compliment of dotfiles and config files including Xfce and luakit
- A full vim environment, including a number of plugins
- A full tmux environment
- A full development environment based on "workstpaces" called GTWS
- A number of useful scripts/commands

See http://apollo.fprintf.net/scripts/ for installation.

TODO - Move this to a github .md file with install instructions

Things to do to setup my env in hyprland:

1. Enable ssh-agent local service:
	systemctl enable --user ssh-agent.service

2. nvim copy/paste integration
	install wl-clipboard
