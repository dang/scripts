! This is designed to work with some gnome keymappings.  Here's what you set:
! Pick Generic 104-key PC for the model, and USA for the layout.  Then, under
! Layout Options, choose Left Alt is swapped with Left Win (for my broken
! laptop).  Unfortunately, you can't use gnome to make capslock *also* be
! escape, just swap it with escape, so this does that, and swaps _ and `.

keycode  49 = underscore asciitilde
keycode  20 = minus grave
! Esc on caps lock :-))
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
! left alt is borked; use win key instead
!keycode  115 = Alt_L
!keysym Super_L = Alt_L
