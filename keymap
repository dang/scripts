! This is designed to work with some gnome keymappings.  Here's what you set:
! Pick Generic 104-key PC for the model, and USA for the layout.  Then, under
! Layout Options, choose Left Alt is swapped with Left Win (for my broken
! laptop).  Choose Make CapsLock an addidional ESC.  ! This swaps _ and `.

keycode  49 = underscore asciitilde
keycode  20 = minus grave
! Esc on caps lock :-))
!remove Lock = Caps_Lock
!keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
! left alt is borked; use win key instead
!keycode  115 = Alt_L
!keysym Super_L = Alt_L
!pointer = 1 8 3 4 5 6 7 2
!pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
